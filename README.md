# Fresh and Rotten Fruit Classification Machine Learning Models

This folder contains the history of the creation of several Machine Learning (ML) models used in the Capstone Project. This model uses a dataset from the Kaggle website, namely [Fruits fresh and rotten for classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification) created by SRIRAM REDDY KALLURI. In the process of making this ML Model, the model is created using two types of algorithms including:


* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* MobileNetV2 (Pre-Trained Model) 


In making some of these ML Models using Image Augmentation to get data from a detection point of view. The ML model created is divided into two types based on the classification of prediction categories, including:


* [2 Categorical Classes](https://github.com/Bangkit-C22-PS021/model-ml-fruit-fresh/tree/main/2%20Categorical%20Class)
* [6 Categorical Classes](https://github.com/Bangkit-C22-PS021/model-ml-fruit-fresh/tree/main/6%20Categorical%20Class)



Both types of category classification have gone through the process of training, validation and testing with an accuracy result of around 99%.
